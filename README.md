# WikIDIOM
## Overview
This mobile application is for users that are interested in expanding their knowledge of language and culture. The information retrieved is the idiom(s), the meaning, and whether a similar one exists in another language. The application also allows collaborators. If a user would like to contribute to the database by adding information about idioms and slang from a specific region is allowed to as long as certain conditions are met. Specific authentication is put in place for security.
Users are able to retrieve idioms and slang by entering keywords, or by entering a location to get a list of idioms that are specific to that place, or by using the world map that is displayed in the application.

### Features 
1. Database The user can click on a specific idiom or slang, then an explanation of the meaning, and a similar idiom in another language (if it exists) will be retrieved and displayed.
2. Create User Account The user will be able to contribute to our database once an account is created and authenticated.
3. Search by keywords This input box can take keywords to find specific idioms that match the input words. This could be useful for users that want to search for idioms based on specific words.
4. Search by location An input box can be added, so the user can input the name of a town/city/country without using the map to be able to retrieve a list of idioms and slangs from that specific place. This could be useful for users that want to search for idioms that are specific to a territory.
